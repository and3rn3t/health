## üîÑ Restoration Process

If any archived component needs to be restored:

1. **Move the component back** to the appropriate active folder
2. **Update imports** in any files that reference it
3. **Test the build** to ensure no breaking changes
4. **Update this index** to reflect the restoration

## üìä Cleanup Results

**Before Cleanup:**

- Total Components: ~120
- Active Components: ~35 (29%)
- Unused Components: ~85 (71%)

**After Cleanup:**

- Active Components: ~35 (100% of visible components)
- Archived Components: ~85 (preserved but organized)

**Benefits Achieved:**

- ‚úÖ Cleaner component navigation in IDE
- ‚úÖ Faster TypeScript checking and builds
- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of active vs. experimental features
- ‚úÖ Reduced cognitive load for developers
- ‚úÖ Organized preservation of all development work
