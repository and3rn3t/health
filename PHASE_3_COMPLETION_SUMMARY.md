## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Node.js Scripts Architecture

```javascript
// Common pattern across all Phase 3 scripts
class DeploymentManager {
  constructor(options = {}) {
    this.dryRun = options.dryRun || false;
    this.verbose = options.verbose || false;
    this.phase = options.phase || 'all';
  }

  async executePhase(phase) {
    // Implementation with error handling, validation, and progress reporting
  }
}
```

### VS Code Task Configuration

```json
{
  "label": "🚀 Node.js Development Workflow",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "node",
  "args": [
    "scripts/node/deploy/platform-deploy.js",
    "--phase",
    "${input:deploymentPhase}"
  ],
  "group": "build",
  "presentation": {
    "echo": true,
    "reveal": "always",
    "focus": false,
    "panel": "shared"
  },
  "problemMatcher": ["$node-sass"],
  "dependsOn": ["🔧 Platform Infrastructure"],
  "dependsOrder": "sequence"
}
```

### Enhanced Settings Configuration

```json
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true,
    "yaml": true,
    "powershell": true,
    "jsonc": true,
    "shellscript": true
  },
  "typescript.suggest.autoImports": true,
  "task.verboseLogging": true,
  "terminal.integrated.enablePersistentSessions": true
}
```
