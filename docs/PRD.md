- **Progression**: Invitation sent → Access granted → Real-time monitoring → Alert notifications → Collaborative care planning
- **Success criteria**: Provides caregivers with timely, relevant health information while respecting user privacy preferences

## Edge Case Handling

- **False Fall Alarms**: User has 30-second window to cancel emergency alerts before contacts are notified
- **Data Import Failures**: Graceful handling of corrupted or incomplete health data with detailed error reporting
- **Emergency Contact Unavailability**: Cascading contact system with backup emergency services integration
- **Privacy Concerns**: Granular privacy controls for what data caregivers can access
- **Device Connectivity Loss**: Offline mode with data sync when connection restored
- **Medical Emergency During Fall**: Integration with emergency services for severe incidents

## Design Direction

The design should feel medical-grade professional yet approachable - clinical accuracy with consumer-friendly warmth. Think of the trust level of medical devices combined with the usability of consumer health apps. The interface should be rich with detailed data visualizations and comprehensive controls, as users need access to deep health insights and emergency features.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using medical blue and warm orange to balance trust with approachability, creating clear distinction between monitoring/analysis features and emergency/alert functions.

- **Primary Color**: Medical Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - Communicates clinical trust, reliability, and medical expertise
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Soft Gray (oklch(0.85 0.02 250)) - Supporting neutral for data backgrounds
  - Deep Navy (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Text and emphasis elements
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 45)) - Emergency alerts, fall risks, and call-to-action elements that require immediate attention
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White #FFFFFF): Deep Navy text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.95 0.01 250)): Deep Navy text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Medical Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 250)): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 5.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange oklch(0.70 0.15 45)): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓
  - Muted (Soft Gray oklch(0.85 0.02 250)): Deep Navy text (oklch(0.25 0.08 250)) - Ratio 6.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typefaces should convey medical precision and modern accessibility - clear, highly legible fonts that work well for both detailed data presentation and emergency situations. Using Inter for its excellent readability at all sizes and clinical feel.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Dashboard Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Metric Labels): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Data Values): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed spacing
  - Caption (Timestamps): Inter Regular/14px/wide spacing
  - Emergency Text: Inter Bold/20px/normal spacing

## Animations

Animations should be medically appropriate - purposeful and calming rather than playful, with special attention to emergency states where motion should be urgent but not anxiety-inducing.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth data transitions convey reliability, while emergency animations create appropriate urgency without panic
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: 
  - Critical alerts: Immediate, attention-grabbing but controlled pulsing
  - Data updates: Gentle transitions that don't disrupt analysis
  - Navigation: Smooth, professional transitions between health sections
