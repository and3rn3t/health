# iOS Development with Docker - What Works and What Doesn't

## ❌ What Docker CANNOT Do for iOS

Docker **cannot** run iOS applications because:

- iOS apps require **macOS and Xcode** to build and run
- iOS Simulator only works on macOS
- Apple's development tools are not available in Docker containers
- Code signing requires macOS keychain access

## ✅ What Docker CAN Do for VitalSense Monitor

Docker is perfect for **backend services** that support your iOS app:

### 1. **Development Backend Services**

```bash
# Start WebSocket server, Redis, and PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d

# Your iOS app connects to these services at:
# WebSocket: ws://localhost:8080
# API: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. **Database Services**

- PostgreSQL for health analytics
- Redis for caching gait analysis data
- Mock data services for testing

### 3. **API Gateway**

- NGINX for routing requests
- Load balancing multiple backend instances

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### iOS Development (macOS Required)

```bash
# 1. Build iOS app
make build

# 2. Run tests
make test

# 3. Start iOS Simulator
make simulator
```

### Backend Services (Any Platform)

```bash
# 1. Start backend services
make backend-services

# 2. View logs
make logs

# 3. Stop services
make stop-services
```

                                              ├─ PostgreSQL
                                              ├─ Redis
                                              └─ NGINX
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Use Docker for backend services only**
2. **Develop VitalSense Monitor with Xcode on macOS**
3. **Test integration between iOS app and Docker services**
4. **Use environment variables for service URLs**

This approach gives you the benefits of containerized backend services while keeping iOS development in its natural environment.
