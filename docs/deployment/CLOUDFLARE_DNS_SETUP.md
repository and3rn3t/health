# Cloudflare DNS Configuration for andernet.dev Health Platform

## 🌐 Current Domain Status

- ✅ **Primary Domain**: `andernet.dev` - Already configured in Cloudflare
- 🎯 **Next Step**: Add health platform subdomains

## 📋 DNS Records to Add

### **Phase 1: Initial Deployment (Ready Now)**

```bash
# Main health platform
health.andernet.dev          CNAME   health-app.workers.dev

# Or use Worker route (configured in wrangler.toml)
# This is automatically handled when you deploy with:
# wrangler deploy --env production
```

### **Phase 2: API Separation (When API traffic grows)**

```bash
# Core health data APIs
api.health.andernet.dev      CNAME   health-api.workers.dev

# Real-time WebSocket services
ws.health.andernet.dev       CNAME   health-ws.workers.dev
```

### **Phase 3: Specialized Services (Before production launch)**

```bash
# Emergency response (critical for fall detection)
emergency.health.andernet.dev CNAME  health-emergency.workers.dev

# File uploads/downloads (Apple Health exports)
files.health.andernet.dev    CNAME   health-files.workers.dev

# Caregiver dashboard access
caregiver.health.andernet.dev CNAME  health-caregiver.workers.dev
```

## ⚡ Quick Setup Commands

### **Deploy Main App (Ready Now)**

```bash
# Deploy to health.andernet.dev
