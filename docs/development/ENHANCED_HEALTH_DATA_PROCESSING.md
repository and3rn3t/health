## Usage Examples

### Single Metric Processing

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8789/api/health-data/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "heart_rate",
    "value": 72,
    "unit": "bpm",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-02T14:00:00.000Z",
    "deviceId": "device-001",
    "userId": "user-123",
    "source": "Apple Watch",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }'
```

### Batch Processing

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8789/api/health-data/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "metrics": [
      {
        "type": "heart_rate",
        "value": 75,
        "unit": "bpm",
        "userId": "user-123"
      },
      {
        "type": "steps",
        "value": 8500,
        "unit": "count",
        "userId": "user-123"
      }
    ],
    "uploadedAt": "2025-09-02T14:00:00.000Z"
  }'
```

### Analytics Retrieval

## Enhanced Analytics Features

### Health Score Algorithm

- **Baseline**: 50 points
- **Metric-specific scoring**: Heart rate (±30), walking steadiness (±30), steps (±20), oxygen saturation (±25)
- **Trend adjustments**: ±5 points based on improvement/decline patterns
- **Range**: 0-100 with real-time updates

### Fall Risk Assessment

- **Low**: Normal readings with good walking steadiness (>75%)
- **Moderate**: Minor concerns or declining trends (50-75%)
- **High**: Multiple concerning readings or poor steadiness (25-50%)
- **Critical**: Immediate intervention required (<25% steadiness)

### Anomaly Detection
