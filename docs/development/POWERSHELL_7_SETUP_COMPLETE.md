# PowerShell 7 Integration - Setup Complete

## ‚úÖ **PowerShell 7 Successfully Configured**

PowerShell 7.5.2 is installed, configured, and working perfectly with VS Code and our enhanced development tools.

## üöÄ **What's Now Working**

### **1. PowerShell 7 in VS Code**

- **Default terminal**: VS Code now uses PowerShell 7 as the default terminal
- **Multiple profiles**: PowerShell 7, PowerShell 5, and PowerShell 7 (No Profile) options
- **Enhanced performance**: Faster execution and better module support

### **2. Enhanced Scripts with PowerShell 7**

All scripts now work properly with PowerShell 7:

- ‚úÖ `scripts/VSCodeIntegration.psm1` - Core utility functions
- ‚úÖ `scripts/simple-probe.ps1` - Health endpoint testing
- ‚úÖ `scripts/simple-context.ps1` - Environment context gathering
- ‚úÖ `scripts/test-pwsh7.ps1` - Integration testing

### **3. VS Code Tasks Updated**

Tasks now use PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) for better performance:

- `probe-health-8787` / `probe-health-8788` - Health checking
- `Get Copilot Context` - Environment information
- `Enhanced Task Runner` - Interactive task execution

## üìã **Key Commands That Work**

### **Health Monitoring**

```powershell
# Test health endpoints
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/simple-probe.ps1 -Port 8788

# Get development context for Copilot
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/simple-context.ps1

# Run integration test
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/test-pwsh7.ps1
```

### **VS Code Integration**

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" to see PowerShell 7 tasks
- Terminal will now default to PowerShell 7
- Enhanced scripts work with full module support

### **Development Workflow**

```powershell
# Start development server (use VS Code task or command line)
wrangler dev --env development --port 8788

# Test with enhanced probe
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/simple-probe.ps1 -Port 8788

# Get environment context for Copilot
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/simple-context.ps1
```

## üîß **Configuration Changes Made**

### **VS Code Settings** (`.vscode/settings.json`)

- Updated terminal profiles to use PowerShell 7 as default
- Added multiple PowerShell profile options
- Enhanced terminal configuration

### **Tasks** (`.vscode/tasks-clean.json`)

- Created clean task configuration using PowerShell 7
- Simplified task definitions for better reliability
- Added input prompts for interactive task selection

### **Scripts**

- All scripts now fully compatible with PowerShell 7
- Enhanced module functions working correctly
- Improved error handling and output formatting

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Use the enhanced VS Code tasks** for development workflow
2. **Test the Enhanced Task Runner** for interactive task selection
3. **Use context gathering** to provide better information to Copilot
4. **Leverage PowerShell 7 features** in future script development

## üìä **Verification Status**

- ‚úÖ PowerShell 7.5.2 installed and accessible
- ‚úÖ VS Code terminal configuration updated
- ‚úÖ Enhanced scripts working with PowerShell 7
- ‚úÖ Module import and functions working
- ‚úÖ HTTP requests and health monitoring working
- ‚úÖ Integration with development servers working
- ‚úÖ VS Code tasks configured for PowerShell 7

The PowerShell-VS Code-Copilot integration is now fully optimized and ready for enhanced development workflow!

## üèÅ **Ready for Production Use**

All components are tested and working. You can now:

- Use PowerShell 7 as your default development shell
- Leverage enhanced scripts for development tasks
- Get better context for Copilot interactions
- Use improved VS Code task integration

The integration issues have been resolved and the development environment is significantly enhanced!
